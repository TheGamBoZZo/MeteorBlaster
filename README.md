# Meteor Blaster

**Meteor Blaster** is an arcade-style space shooter game developed in Python using the Pygame library. Players control a spaceship to destroy meteors and dodge obstacles, aiming to achieve high scores. The game includes power-ups, customizable aesthetics, and sounds to enhance gameplay.

## Game Mechanics

- **Meteors**: Randomly sized meteors spawn from the top of the screen and move downwards. Players earn points by shooting meteors.
- **Rapid-Fire Power-Up**: Golden stars appear occasionally; collecting one enables rapid-fire mode for a limited time.
- **Collision Detection**: Meteors hitting the spaceship result in a game over, prompting the Game Over screen.
- **Difficulty**: The speed and number of meteors increase as the game progresses.

## Code Structure

- **Spaceship Class**: Handles the spaceshipâ€™s position, movement, and shooting mechanics.
- **Projectile Class**: Manages the bullets shot by the spaceship.
- **Meteor Class**: Randomly spawns meteors with variable sizes and controls their movement.
- **Power-Up Class**: Manages the appearance and behavior of golden stars for rapid-fire mode.
- **Game Loop**: Contains the main logic for rendering, game state updates, and event handling.

## Assets
- **Sound Files**:
  - **Background Music**: `assets/music.mp3`
  - **Collision Sound**: `assets/crash.wav`

Ensure all assets are placed in an `assets` folder in the same directory as the game file for proper loading.

## Future Improvements

- **More Power-Ups**: Adding additional power-ups with unique effects.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Introducing levels or difficulty scaling based on time survived.
- **Leaderboard**: Storing high scores locally or online for competitive play.
- **Visual Customization**: Additional spaceship designs and backgrounds for player customization.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Pygame Issues**: Ensure Pygame is correctly installed by running `pip show pygame` to confirm.
- **File Paths**: Make sure the paths to images and sounds are correctly set. Default paths assume an `assets` folder in the project directory.
